# Synthetic workload: AutoSketch vs. ASAP

Results of ProjectASAP/ASAPQuery#777's synthetic workload on the **mixed
template set** (the 10 templates, 50 RQEs), scaled by shared replicas r = 8
(on one metric, 92 RQEs) and by m = 8 and 16 metrics (one copy of the
template set per metric, 50 · m RQEs). One accuracy level, p95: 95% in each
family's own metric (rank, relative value and relative error at most 0.05;
top-k precision at least 0.95).

**Cost model: cost by use** (sketch-bench `docs/rqe_optimizer_cost_model.md`,
"Cost by use and batch latency", #188): `w_cpu · AUC(CPU) + w_mem ·
AUC(memory)`, CPU elastic, at two weight settings (CPU only, in vCPU; AWS
Fargate's per-vCPU and per-GB prices, in $/hour). CPU covers ingest (on
`⌈ρ⌉` workers split by sample), compaction of each closed window, and one
query job (merge, then estimate) per firing; memory covers ingest, storage,
compaction and query memory, each counted once.

**Latency is reported, not constrained (version 1, no SLA).** A plan's query
latency is its worst batch latency, which with elastic CPU is its longest
chain (the newest window's compaction, then the query). ASAP and
PerQuery-CostAware are solved without a bound (the cheapest plan) and for 12
latency bounds log-spaced from the tightest feasible bound to the unbounded
plan's latency, plus a bound at AutoSketch's latency: each method's
**cost-latency frontier**. AutoSketch-Adapted ignores latency and is one
point. AutoSketch's planning time is its search **plus its measured
benchmark**: `scripts/autosketch_benchmark_time.py` ran approxbench's
accuracy benchmark (1e8 items, exact baseline and scoring) once per distinct
probed (config, data shape), serially on idle clnode155
(`autosketch-benchmark-times.json`), and charged it once per probed
(metric, config).

Runs: one workload per CloudLab node, all Intel Xeon E5-2683 v3 @ 2.00 GHz
with 56 cores (mixed on clnode155, r = 8 on clnode178, m = 8 on clnode167,
m = 16 on clnode138), 2026-10-08, `--runs 3`,
sketch-bench at #188 + this branch. No RQE was dropped and no sanity check
failed (ASAP ≤ PerQuery, ASAP ≤ AutoSketch, each frontier monotone).

Files: `synthetic-*.json` (raw: every method's plan, unbounded and bounded,
per weight setting, without per-RQE choices; rerun with the runner for them), `summary_synthetic.md` (every point),
`fig_frontier.png` (cost vs. query latency per workload and weight setting;
ASAP and PerQuery frontiers as lines, AutoSketch as a point, every point
labeled), `fig_planning_time.png` (planning time vs. RQEs over m).

## Results

Each method's cheapest plan and its latency, and ASAP's and PerQuery's cost
at no more than AutoSketch's latency (absolute costs):

Planning time (CPU-only weights; AutoSketch's includes its measured
benchmark; the paper's 60 s per probe is a reference only):

| RQEs | ASAP (candidates + MILP) | PerQuery-CostAware | AutoSketch: search | AutoSketch: search + measured benchmark | (reference: + 60 s per probe) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 50 | 0.758 s | 0.65 s | 0.00197 s | 212 s | 600 s |
| 400 | 6.82 s | 5.55 s | 0.0153 s | 1.7e+03 s | 4.8e+03 s |
| 800 | 14.7 s | 11.7 s | 0.031 s | 3.39e+03 s | 9.6e+03 s |

## Template sets

The results above are the 10-template mixed set, now named `classic`
(`--synthetic` writes it as `synthetic-templatesclassic-*.json`; the
committed `templatesall` tables and results predate the rename and hold
exactly today's `classic` tables). `all` is `classic` plus six
multi-grouping templates on two metrics with an ordered label schema. Each
metric value is one stream read at several groupings, so a fine deployment
can serve a coarse RQE (a roll-up) and one Hydra grid can serve them all.
Every RQE of these templates names its `grouping` and `covers_share` τ: the
accuracy target covers the groups holding at least τ of the stream's records,
plus always the largest group (`null`: every group). The generator computes
each group's share as the product of its labels' shares (labels are drawn
independently given their parents) and writes each RQE's `covered_groups`,
`min_covered_share` and `covered_min_N` (the smallest covered group's items
per window), and `max_covered_share` and `covered_max_N` (the largest's); the table's `schemas` gives each metric's labels.

| Metric | Labels (values, Zipf skew) | Rate | Values |
|---|---|---|---|
| `http` | region 4 (0.5), service 25 (1.1), endpoint 25 per service (1.1; 625 in all), status 4 (2.0); 1e4 label combinations | 2e6 samples/s (as `classic`) | `user_id`: Zipf 0.8 over 1e6; `latency`: Pareto a = 2, scaled per service, one endpoint 10x slower |
| `flows` | dst_subnet 1e3 (1.1), dst_port 1e3 (1.2), proto 3 (uniform) | 4e6 samples/s | `src_ip`: uniform over 1e6, plus a DDoS burst: the least popular subnet (999) gets 5% of the traffic from 1e4 sources |

`flows` runs at twice the rate so its finest grouping, {dst_subnet,
dst_port} (1e6 groups), holds 1,200 items per group in 5m, above the
curves' first N (1e3). The burst targets a tail subnet so that it is
visible: its share rises to just over 5%, so template 11 covers it.

The runner reads each value's data shape (Zipf θ and K, or the Pareto a), the
groups per grouping and the coverage; the other fields (label skew beyond the
shares, latency scaling, the anomaly, the burst's sources) describe the data
and are not modeled. Accuracy is read at N items per group per window at
both the smallest covered group (`covered_min_N`; for `covers_share` =
`null` the smallest group of all) and the largest (`covered_max_N`), and
the worse of the two reads holds (unknown if either is): KLL, DD and HLL
error does not fall as N grows, so the largest group can be the hardest
(sketch-bench#189). The
generator fails if any RQE's `covered_min_N` is below the curves' first N
(1e3). The skew of the counted value is the same in every group; label skew
changes only the group sizes. (RQEs without a `grouping`, `classic`'s, are
read at the mean group's items, `max_N`, as before.)

| # | Query | Groupings | Covers | Groups (mean items per group in 5m) | Covered groups (smallest covered group's items in 5m) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 11 | distinct src_ip | {dst_subnet} | share ≥ 5% | 1e3 (1.2e6) | 4, the burst subnet among them (6e7) |
| 12 | distinct src_ip | {dst_port}, {dst_subnet, dst_port}, {dst_port, proto} | share ≥ 5% | 1e3, 1e6, 3e3 (1.2e6, 1.2e3, 4e5) | 3, 1, 3 (7.4e7, 4.7e7, 9.2e7) |
| 14 | distinct user_id | {region}, {service}, {region, service}, {service, endpoint} | share ≥ 1% | 4, 25, 100, 625 (1.5e8 to 9.6e5) | 4, 21, 23, 16 (1.1e8, 6.3e6, 6.3e6, 6.3e6) |
| 15 | distinct user_id | all 15 non-empty subsets of http's labels | share ≥ 5% | 4 to 1e4 (1.5e8 to 6e4) | 1 to 5 (1.3e7 to 1.1e8) |
| 16 | p99 latency | {service}, {region, service}, {service, status} | all groups | 25, 100, 100 (2.4e7, 6e6, 6e6) | all (5.2e6, 9.3e5, 2.3e5) |
| 17 | distinct user_id | {service, endpoint} (negative control) | all groups | 625 (9.6e5) | all (4.5e4) |

The plot scripts title `classic` "mixed" and `all` "mixed + multi-grouping"
(so the committed `templatesall` results, which are `classic`'s, need
regenerating under their new name before they are re-plotted).

Each repeats every minute over 5m and 15m windows: 54 RQEs, so `all` has
104 (shared replicas repeat them at their own interval; each of the `m`
metrics has its own `data_i/http` and `data_i/flows`). Distinct counts are
HLL (Zipf θ and K of the value), the p99 KLL and DDSketch (Pareto a = 2),
at the p95 level. `covers_share` is carried through to each choice in the
runner's output.

On a freshly generated `all` table (`--synthetic`; r = 1, p95, CPU
weights, `--runs 1`) with the committed saturation inputs (the committed
`templatesall` tables are `classic`'s), no RQE is dropped and no sanity
check fails; ASAP serves 40 of the 54 new RQEs from a finer deployment:
every RQE of templates 14, 15 and 17 from an HLL at {region, service,
status} or at the full label set (bar the RQEs at those two groupings),
{dst_port} from {dst_port, proto}, and the p99 by {service} from DDSketch
at {region, service} or {service, status}. 15 active deployments in all,
5.05 vCPU; PerQuery-CostAware 11.8 vCPU; AutoSketch 3.42e+03 vCPU.

## Inputs

Costs and accuracy come from one saturation-study directory `DIR`, the same
inputs the planner reads (#174, #178, #179). The one these results used is
committed in `../autosketch-vs-asap-inputs/saturation/`, and the tables in
`../autosketch-vs-asap-inputs/tables/`:
- `DIR/out_grid_1e7_cost/`: the accuracy grid to N = 1e7, including the
  cost table's shape (Zipf 1.1 over 1e4 keys, Pareto a = 2), with merge
  curves for the lossy sketches;
- `DIR/out_1e9/`: the targeted points past 1e7 that the workload reads;
- `DIR/optimizer_cost/rqe_atomic_costs.json`: the cost table.

The tables from `export_autosketch_eval_table.py --synthetic` hold only the
workload: RQEs, streams, targets and data shapes.

## Reproduce

```sh
cargo build -p aqpbm-cli --release
# Accuracy grid with merge curves (parallel), then the targeted 1e9 points.
python3 scripts/study_saturation.py --phase accuracy --n-max 1e7 --seeds 3 \
    --jobs 48 --merge-shards-list 1,4,16,64 --out DIR/out_grid_1e7_cost
python3 scripts/study_saturation.py --phase accuracy --n-max 1e9 --seeds 3 \
    --jobs 16 --points-from POINTS.csv --out DIR/out_1e9
# Cost table, serially on a quiet machine.
python3 scripts/study_saturation.py --phase optimizer-cost --out DIR/optimizer_cost

# Workload tables and plan.tsv, then the runs.
python3 scripts/export_autosketch_eval_table.py --synthetic --out TABLES
# Or use the committed inputs: TABLES=rqe-optimizer/results/autosketch-vs-asap-inputs/tables,
# DIR=rqe-optimizer/results/autosketch-vs-asap-inputs/saturation.
SATURATION_DIR=DIR scripts/run_autosketch_vs_asap_synthetic.sh TABLES run
# AutoSketch's measured benchmark (serially, on an idle machine; writes
# benchmark_secs_measured into the results), then the figures.
python3 scripts/autosketch_benchmark_time.py --binary ./target/release/approxbench \
    --out OUT/autosketch-benchmark-times.json OUT/synthetic-*.json
scripts/run_autosketch_vs_asap_synthetic.sh TABLES plot
```

`--merge-shards-list` and `POINTS.csv` follow the workloads' queries: the
merge counts their KLL deployments can reach (`L / x`), and the points whose
items per instance exceed 1e7. These are the synthetic workload's (Zipf 1.1
over 1e4 keys, Pareto a = 2) and alibaba's quantiles (Pareto a = 3, up to
1.6e8 items).
