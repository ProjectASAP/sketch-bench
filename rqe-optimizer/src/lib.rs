//! v1 brute-force solver for the RQE -> sketch-deployment mapping problem.
//! `docs/rqe_sketch_deployment_v1.md` is the problem statement; doc comments
//! cite its section numbers.
//!
//! Three independent stages, so an ILP can replace [`enumerate`] alone:
//! [`candidates`] builds 𝒟 and per-RQE eligibility (§3), [`enumerate`]
//! searches (§4), [`objectives`] scores (§5).
//!
//! Every number the algorithm uses is caller-supplied -- no constants here.
