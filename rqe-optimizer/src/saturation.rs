//! Sketch accuracy read from the saturation study's error-vs-N curves
//! (`scripts/study_saturation.py`, #130, #140) at the number of items a
//! deployment's answer covers. Design decisions: #156.
//!
//! The curve is read at the number of items one group receives over the
//! RAQE's whole lookback: series per group times scrapes per lookback. For
//! sketches that merge exactly, that holds whether the answer is one sketch
//! or a merge of many smaller-window sketches. KLL and top-k merge lossily
//! (#131): an answer merged from `L / x` windows reads the curve of the sketch
//! merged from that many shards (#158).
//!
//! The cost table's sketch accuracies are not read: each is one point on a
//! curve, at the row's `measured_at`, and [`SaturationCurves::check_cost_table`]
//! checks that the two agree there (#171). Both come from one study run
//! (`study_saturation.py --phase optimizer-cost`, #174).
//!
//! Hydra reads none of these curves: its accuracy is measured per dataset
//! and grouping (`hydra_saturation.csv`, `docs/rqe_optimizer_hydra.md`
//! §2.4), see [`SaturationCurves::accuracy`].
